# Pomodoro timer
A <strong>Pomodoro timer</strong> to help you focus on your work. 
<hr>
<i>This application is a digital version of Francesco Cirillo's famous tomato-kitchen timer. During 25 minutes he promised himself to only focus one task, after which he would take a 5 minute break. He called this cycle a "Pomodoro".</i> 
<hr>
This application makes you work 4 Pomodoro's. There is <strong>no pause button</strong>. If you stop, you will have to start from the beginning again. If you succeed, there is a 30min break waiting for you. The application will pop-up to the front of your screen when a work/break cycle is finished. To get the screen to the back again, click the application once and return to your task.
